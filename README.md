# Algorithm’s Project

## Twitter Followers Project

## In this project, you are given a comma-separated file to represent some Twitter users and

the users they follow. The file name is “twitter.csv”. Each row represents a certain user’s id
and the id of another user he/she follows.

e.g.

```
1,2 //user with id = 1 follows the user with id = 2
2,5 //user with id = 2 follows the user with id = 5
3,5 //user with id = 3 follows the user with id = 5
1,6 //user with id = 1 follows the user with id = 6
```
## You are required to make a program that stores this data in a suitable data structure that

helps your program to retrieve the Top-influencer that has the highest number of followers,
when required, and then the next Top-influencer and so on.

Also, you have to support a complexity analysis illustration to your program’s algorithm in
any illustration form; a piece of paper, presentation slides, ... etc.

## As a bonus question, you may take a Twitter account id from the user and calculate its

closest group of Twitter users to recommend as a new friend. Closest means they have at
least a threshold number of Twitter accounts in common. One of your responsibilities in this
bonus task is to determine this threshold.

The attached dataset contains 2,420,766 different following states (edges) and around
81,000 different Twitter accounts.
